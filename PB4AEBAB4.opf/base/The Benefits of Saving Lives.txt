Benefits of Saving Lives

by Chatral Rinpoche

I bow down before the Lama, Buddha Amitāyus,And the bodhisattvas in training.I shall now in
brief describe the benefitsOf freeing animals and ransoming their lives.

To save animals from slaughter or any mortal danger,With entirely pure motivation and conduct,Is
without doubt a practice to be taken upBy all followers of the Buddha Śākyamuni.Many
are the sūtras, tantras and commentariesWhich describe in detail the advantages it brings,And
countless learned and accomplished masters of India and TibetHave stressed the value and
importance of benefitting beings.Even in the basic vehicle one avoids inflicting harm on
others.In the mahāyāna this is the very training of a bodhisattva,And in the secret mantra,
a principal samaya of the ratna family.

The reasoning behind this is as follows: in this world,Nothing is as dear to someone as his
or her own life,So there is no greater crime than taking life away,And no conditioned virtue
brings greater meritThan the act of saving beings and ransoming their lives.Therefore,
should you wish for happiness and good,Exert yourself in this, the most supreme of paths,Which
is proven through scriptures and through reasoning,And is free of obstacles and potential
dangers.

Consider your own body, and, with this as an example,Avoid doing anything that might bring harm
to others.Make every effort not to kill any living creature—Birds, fish, deer, cattle
and even tiny insects—And strive instead to save their lives,Offering them protection from
every fear.The benefit of doing so is beyond imagining.This is the best practice for your
own longevity,And the greatest ritual for the living or deceased.It is my main practice of
benefitting others.It dispels all external and internal adversity and obstacles;Effortlessly
and spontaneously, it brings favourable conditions;And, when inspired by the noble mind
of bodhicitta andCompleted with dedication and pure aspiration prayers,It will lead one
to complete enlightenment,And the accomplishment of one’s own and others’ welfare—Of this
you need have no doubts at all!

Those whose minds incline to virtue and acts of meritShould prohibit hunting and fishing on
their land.Some birds, in particular, such as geese and cranes,Are impelled by their karma
to migrateAnd fly south in autumn, north in spring.At times, weary from the efforts of their
flight,Or having lost their way, some are forced to land,Distressed, afraid and anxious;
when this happens,You should not throw stones or shoot at them,Nor try to kill them or
do them any harm.Protect them so they may easily fly once more.To offer care and affection
to sentient beingsIn desperate situations who lack protectionBrings just as much merit as
the meditationOn emptiness with compassion as its core—So it has been said by glorious Lord
Atiśa.

Lamas, officials, monks, nuns, men and women,In all the places over which you have control,Exert
every influence and do all within your powerTo release animals and ransom their lives,While
encouraging others to do the same.

In all those places where this is done,Sickness among people and livestock will cease,Harvests
will be plentiful and life will be long.All will enjoy happiness and wellbeing in abundance,And
at death let go of deluded experience,Before finding an excellent rebirth within
the higher realms.Ultimately, there is no doubt that this will lead one easilyTo find the
supreme and perfect state of awakening.

In response to the request of Doctor Dordrak,Who offered a pure silk scarf and a hundred Nepali
rupees,The one called Chatral Sangye Dorje,Who strives continuously to ransom lives,Wrote
down spontaneously whatever came to mind.By the merit of this may all sentient beingsCome
to practise enlightened actions!

Mamakoling samanta!
